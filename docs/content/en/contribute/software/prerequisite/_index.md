Before using the **Keptn Lifecycle Toolkit**,
you must have these tools in your system for development contribution,
follow the links for further installation guides.
You may skip this step and go straight to the [document-setup]()
if you enjoy writing.

## Prerequisites

* [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): a tool for containerization,
which allows software applications to run in isolated environments
and makes it easier to deploy and manage them. Other Alternative option can be
[**Rancher Desktop**](https://rancherdesktop.io/) an open-source desktop application that
enables developers to build, test, and deploy applications in containers on their
local machines.
* A Kubernetes `cluster >= Kubernetes 1.24` .If you donâ€™t have one,
we recommend Kubernetes-in-Docker(kind) to set up your local development environment.
* [**kubectl**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/): a command-line interface tool used for deploying
and managing applications on Kubernetes clusters.
* [**kustomize**](https://kustomize.io/): a tool used for customizing Kubernetes resource configurations
and generating manifests.
* [**Helm**](https://helm.sh/): a package manager for Kubernetes that
simplifies the deployment and management of applications on a Kubernetes cluster.
